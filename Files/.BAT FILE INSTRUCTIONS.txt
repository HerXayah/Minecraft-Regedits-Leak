1. When opening the .bat file make sure to run it as administrator, if an windows defender
prevents you from doing so, click more info, and run anyway. The file is not a rat and you
can scan and look at the code yourself.

2. After doing so, wait for every line of code to process, then click any key you wish.

3. If you wish to close the file all you have to do is click a key again.

4. ENJOY :D <3
