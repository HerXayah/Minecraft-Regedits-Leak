next go to system protection and click on the create button! name the restore point how ever you want!
and click ok, let it create!

HOW TO UNDO THEM IN CASE OF LAG ETC

To undo the regedit settings: go to the same location as where you created it click on the system restore button
and select the restore point you made before, and run it, it will take a little bit of time, DONT WORRY!
i wont remove any files or settings you have nothing important will be effected!
